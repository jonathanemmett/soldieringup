<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
<p>SU is a community…a Nation if you will. A Nation where both Veterans and Entrepreneurs develop relationships and foster a cooperative spirit of promotion and support.</p>

<p>By joining the SU Nation, both the entrepreneur and the Veteran can leverage their resources and skills to both grow and start a business.</p>

<p>Through the SU Nation the Entrepreneur provides the added “brain” capital and expertise into the Veteran’s business, all while the Veteran includes in its advertising the promotion of the supporting company.</p>

<p>Through this mutual relationship both businesses are able to achieve more success with less expenditure of capital. Through the growth of small and new businesses enterpreneurship can and does change our world for the better.</p>

<h1>THE MOVEMENT</h1>
<p>With the high rate of homelessness, unemployment and ????, many veterans are needing to turn to starting a business of their own as a way to provide for themselves and their families.</p>
<p>In many cases the Veteran may lack the necessary set of skills or capital to start or buy a new business</p>
